Hooks are used like components, it's made to be reused in different parts of the application.
The difference is that hooks are functional parts of the application that will be reused instead of an visual part like a component.

Can notice in the Hooks files is that there's no need for and .tsx file, cause it doesn't use JSX. So it can be only .ts a normal js/ts file.
